# CS50 Problems

These are my attempts at the CS50 Problems.  You can find the OpenCourseWare notes [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/)

C is not a language that I'm fully comfortable with.  Feel free to reach out if you feel I can complete these problems better.  

## Problems attempted

### Week 1
1. hello: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/labs/1/hello/
1. population: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/labs/1/population/
1. mario1 (currently attempting): https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/1/mario/less/

## Installation
There is a custom library you need to install called cs50.h.  You can find the installation instructions [here](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/c/)

You will need to link this library when you build the code.  You can do this using the following command:  
`clang file_name.c -lcs50 -o file_name_output`
